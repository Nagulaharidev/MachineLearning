## Decision Tree

### Type - 

**UnSupervised**

### Example Inference  


	Classification


### Use cases

	Data Exploration
	Customer Categorization

**K** is the number of Clusters, 

if there are multiple K-Means are achieved.

**Total Variation** between **Cluster size** plays important role and **Less variation** becomes winner

### Points to Remember

One cluster results in maximum variation
Two clusters reduces the variation
Three clusters reduces the variation more
And so on....

The Variation doesn't change beyond one poinnt (# of Cluster)



K-Means Unsupervised algorithm that attempts to find discretegroupings within data, where members of a group are assimilar as possible to one another and as different as possiblefrom members of other groups. The Euclidean distancebetween these points represents the similarity of thecorresponding observations.K-Means will take in a list of things with attributes. You specifywhich attributes indicate similarity and the algorithm will attemptto group them together such that they are with other similarthings. “Similarity” is calculated based on the distance betweenthe identifying attributes.{UNSUPERVISED}
