## Decision Tree

### Type - 

**UnSupervised**

### Example Inference  


	Classification


### Use cases

	Data Exploration
	Customer Categorization

**K** is the number of Clusters, 

if there are multiple K-Means are achieved.

**Total Variation** between **Cluster size** plays important role and **Less variation** becomes winner

### Points to Remember

One cluster results in maximum variation
Two clusters reduces the variation
Three clusters reduces the variation more
And so on....

The Variation doesn't change beyond one poinnt (# of Cluster)
