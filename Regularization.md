Regularization is to modify model line when we have additional data.
It is mathematical process which will descentize your model line.

L1 Regularizations - **Lasso Regression**
L2 Regularizations - **Ridge Regression**

We apply regularization when our model in **overfit**.
regularization can be achieved through regression.
