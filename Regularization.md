## Regularization• We apply regularization when our model is overfit.• Regularization is achieved through regression.• Regression desensitizes our model to the data such that it generalizes better.

### Regularization through Regression• L1 regularization (Lasso Regression)• L2 regularization (Ridge Regression)
