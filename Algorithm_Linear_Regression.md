 **Model Line**

Dependent variable is continuous in nature. (numeric Value)



X axis - Independent Varaible

Y Axis - Dependent Variable


**Simple Linear Equation**


y = c + mx.  (m = slope of model line), c = Intercept


Linear Learner AlgorithmLinear models are supervised learning algorithms for regression,binary classification or multiclass classification problems. Yougive the model labels (x,y) with x being high-dimensional vectorand y is a numeric label. The algorithm learns a linear function,or, for classification problems, a linear threshold function, andmaps a vector x to an approximation of label y.To use this algorithm you need a number or list of numbers which yieldssome other number…the answer you’re after. You can use it to predicta specific value or a threshold for grouping purposes.{SUPERVISED}
