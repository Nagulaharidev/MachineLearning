Which Line fits the **Model** Best
Difference between Line and Observed Data
Residual is distance of Observed Data to Line.

Find out the Sum of Residuals of all the Lines.  Model Line haveing Least Sum of Residuals will be best fit line.

Sum of Residuals are Squared to make it as positive.


Graph :  X = Slope of Model Line, Y = Sum of Squares

This is to find out Slope of Model Line

"Gradient Descent" Techni Learning rate - initial step size

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model.
