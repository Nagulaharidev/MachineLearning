### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) TEXT ANALYSIS {UNSUPERVISED}Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is an unsupervisedlearning algorithm that attempts to describe a set ofobservations as a mixture of distinct categories. LDA is mostcommonly used to discover a user-specified number of topicsshared by documents within a text corpus. Here eachobservation is a document, the features are the presence (oroccurrence count) of each word, and the categories are thetopics.Used to figure out how similar documents are based on thefrequency of similar words.
