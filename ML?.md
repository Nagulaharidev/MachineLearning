## What is ML?
Machine Learning is subset of AI.
Wiki for Machine Learning is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Popular Machine Learning Models are as follows
  **Linear Regression**
  **Logistic Regression**
  **Support Vector Machine**
  **Decision Tree**

Machine Learning Process is as follows:

**Data** + **Algorithm** _(e.g. Linear Regression)_ ----> **Train** the Data ---> Generate **Model** ---> **Predictions** for Test Data


Overfitting does not work well for predictions but Model helps
