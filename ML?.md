## What is ML?
Machine Learning is subset of AI.
Wiki for Machine Learning is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Popular Machine Learning Models are as follows
  **Linear Regression**
  **Logistic Regression**
  **Support Vector Machine**
  **Decision Tree**

Machine Learning Process is as follows:

**Data** + **Algorithm** _(e.g. Linear Regression)_ ----> **Train** the Data ---> Generate **Model** ---> **Predictions** for Test Data


Overfitting does not work well for predictions but Model helps


## What is Machine Learning?

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
