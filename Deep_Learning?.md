**Deep Learning**
Deep Learning is motivated by organic brain

**Three major components of Brains are**

Dendrites  (we can call them as *Input*)
Neuron     (this is *Network*)
Axon Terminals (this will be _output_)

in Deep Learning it is called as **Artificial Neuron Network** (built using interconnected _Artifical Nuron_)


**Activation Function** is executed in **Artifical Neuron Network**
