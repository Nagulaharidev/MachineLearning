### Random Cut Forest ANOMALY DETECTION {UNSUPERVISED}Detect anomalous data points within a set, like spikes in timeseries data, breaks in periodicity or unclassifiable points.Useful way to find outliers when it’s not feasible to plotgraphically. RCF is designed to work with n-dimentional input.Find occurrences in the data that are significantly beyond“normal” (usually more than 3 standard deviations) that couldmess up your model training.
