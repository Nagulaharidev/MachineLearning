## Splitting and Randomization Data

Split data in **Training**, **Validation** and **Testing** sets

Data is collected in Batches, therefore Before Splitting Data do the following:

Always randomize the data
Even you're unware of data clumping
Some Algorithms will shuffle data during training, but not between the training and test data sets.
